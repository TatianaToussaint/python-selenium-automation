                        Tuna tartare is a simple dish consisting of raw tuna that is cut up into small cubes with whatever flavors one prefers added in. Traditionally tartare is prepared with beef, however, using fish has become extremely popular and makes this dish appealing to a larger group of people.

                    <h2>How to Make Tuna Tartare:</h2>
                    <p>
                        When buying tuna to make tartare, make sure to buy it from a reputable shop and always make sure to ask someone if it is sushi grade tuna. That is what youâ€™re looking for! The fish should have a nice deep red color and there should be no fishy smell. Ensure the tuna remains chilled and on ice until right before it is prepared and served.
                    </p>

                        I recommend always using some acid in any raw fish recipes (tartare, carpaccio, ceviche, etc.). The acid creates a reaction (denaturing the protein), which essentially breaks down and rearranges the proteins in the fish the way they would be if it had been cooked. This not only takes us back to our high school chemistry days but also makes the fish safe to eat raw, which is pretty important.

                        Another important thing to remember when making this tuna tartare in sesame ginger sauce is to use a sharp knife! This will make the process SO much easier when preparing the tartare and will keep the fish tender!
